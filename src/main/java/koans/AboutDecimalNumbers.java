     * # Converting a measure of length

     * Write a method named 'toCm' which has a parameter for a number of inches, and returns the conversion in centimeters.
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS  --------------
     * 
     * This time, the parameter cannot be an integer, because we want to be able to convert fractions of inches as well.
     * 
     * In Java, decimal numbers are represented with a type named 'double'. Ex:
     * 
     *     double pi = 3.14;
     * 
     * To convert from inches to centimeters, simply multiply by 2.54.
     * 
     * -------------------------------
     * 
     * Expected result:
     * 
     * toCm(2.0) should return 5.08

     * Use the value 3.14 for pi.

     * # Computing how long a robot is traveling step 2

     * Write a method named 'wheelRotations' which computes the number of rotations of the wheel given the number of rotations of the motor and the gear ratio.
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS  --------------
     * 
     * The gear ratio is how many rotations the wheel is turning when the motor rotates once.
     * For example, if the motor has to turn 5 rotations to make the wheel rotate once, the ratio is 1/5 = 0.2.
     * 
     * -------------------------------
     * 
     * Expected result:
     * 
     * wheelRotations(2.0, 0.2) should return 0.4

     * 
     * - The number of rotations of the motor.
     * - The gear ratio of the gearbox.
     * - The wheel radius.
     * 
     * Warning! Do not recode the computations already coded in the previous 2 methods. Instead, reuse the previous 2 methods in this one.
     * 
     * -------------------------------
