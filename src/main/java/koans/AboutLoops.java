     * # First loop

     * Write a method named 'helloNTimes' which has an integer parameter 'times' and displays 'Hello' in the console times times.
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS   --------------
     * 
     * To do things multiple times in Java, you can use the 'while' loop.
     * A while loop looks a lot like an if condition, except it will execute its block of code again and again while the condition stays true. Ex:
     * 
     *     int times = 3;
     *     while (times > 0) {
     *         // It will take 3 executions of this block of code before the condition becomes false.
     *         // So Java will execute it 3 times, and then move on to the rest of the code.
     *         System.out.println("Still executing");
     *         // We can modify the value of an existing variable. We take advantage of this capability here.
     *         times = times -1;
     *     }

     * 
     * ---------   TIPS   --------------
     * 
     * Reuse the 'isMultiple' method in the AboutMoreMethods class. To reuse a method in an other class, write the class name, then a '.', before calling the method. Ex:
     * 
     *     AboutConsoleAndVariables.sayHelloInConsole();  // Will display 'Hello!' in the console
