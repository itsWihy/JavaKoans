     * # Introduction to the 'Not 7!' game
     * 
     * These koans are a bit special because they put everything you learned so far into practice.
     * 
     * You will gradually code everything necessary for a 2 players game called 'Not 7!'.
     * 
     * Each player has only one turn. On its turn, the player will throw 2 dice as many times as they wish.
     * 
     * However, if at any time the result for one throw is 7, the player loses immediately.
     * 
     * Otherwise, when the player decides to pass and stop throwing, their score is the sum of all the dice results so far.
     * 
     * Here is a game example, in the console:
     * 
     * Player 1, it's your turn!
     * 
     * You threw 4 and 5.
     * Your result so far: 9.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 3 and 1.
     * Your result so far: 13.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 2 and 6.
     * Your result so far: 21.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * n
     * 
     * Well done, your score is 21!
     * 
     * Player 2, it's your turn!
     * 
     * You threw 2 and 3.
     * Your result so far: 5.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 4 and 4.
     * Your result so far: 13.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 2 and 1.
     * Your result so far: 16.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 3 and 3.
     * Your result so far: 22.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * n
     * 
     * Well done, your score is 22!
     * 
     * Congratulations, player 2 wins!!!
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Here is another game example, where one unlucky player is throwing a 7:
     * 
     * Player 1, it's your turn!
     * 
     * You threw 3 and 2.
     * Your result so far: 5.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 5 and 6.
     * Your result so far: 16.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * n
     * 
     * Well done, your score is 16!
     * 
     * Player 2, it's your turn!
     * 
     * You threw 2 and 3.
     * Your result so far: 5.
     * Do you want to throw again [y/n]?
     * y
     * You threw 2 and 5.
     * Oh no, Not 7! You lose!
     * 
     * Congratulations, player 1 wins!!!

    /**
     * # Rolling a 6 sided die
     * 
     * Write a method 'die6()' returning the result of a 6-face die throw as an integer.
     * 
     * ---------   TIPS --------------
     * 
     * To generate a random number between 0 and 1, use the method random(). Ex:
     * 
     *     double someNumber = random(); // 'someNumber' can be anything between 0 and 1
     * 
     * Try to think about what computations would be needed to go from a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 0 and 6.
     * 
     * Now, the result of the computation will be a decimal number, and you will need to round it to the next integer.
     * For example, if the result of your previous computation is 3.2, you will need to round it to 4. You can do that with:
     * 
     *     double rounded = Math.ceil(3.2) // 'rounded' is 4.0
     * 
     * Finally, you will need to convert that decimal number to an int. You can do this conversion by specifying the type you want to convert into in parentheses. Ex:
     * 
     *     int roundedAsInt = (int)4.0; // from double to int
     * 
     * -------------------------------
     * 
     * Expected result:
     * 
     * die6() should return an int between 1 and 6 randomly

    /**
     * # BONUS
     * 
     * If you made it this far, congratulations! You now know a lot about programming!!!
     * Before the next Koan though, what about the ability to launch your game so you can play with a friend?
     * 
     * In Java, in order for a program to know what to execute, you have to create a method called 'main' somewhere.
     * The method must look exactly like this:
     * 
     *     public static void main(String[] args) {
     *       // The code to execute when the program starts
     *     }
     * 
     * For example, the Koans are running because the class 'EnglishPathToEnlightment' on which you right-click to start the Koans, contains such a method.
     * 
     * So go ahead, and create such a method in this AboutNot7Game class and call your 'not7Gamev2' method in it.
     * 
     * Then, right-click on AboutNot7Game.java in the explorer and choose 'Run Java'. Your game is running for real!
